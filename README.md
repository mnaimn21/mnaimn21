My motto is **Better Savage Than Sorry**, which describe my natural behavior of work hard **NOW** or spent the rest of your life regretting.

I'm a _Software Engineer_ from Kuala Lumpur, and currently working as Software Engineer at **INVOKE**. I am specialized in front-end developement but currently exploring back-end. 

The framework that I familiar with : 

  - React JS
  - Bootstrap
  - Tailwind
  - Material UI
  - Core UI 
  - PHP 7
  - Laravel 8
